# Weekly timetable {.unnumbered #timetabling}

The weekly schedule for autumn 2022 is shown in table \@ref(tab:schedtable), based on [timetables.manchester.ac.uk](https://timetables.manchester.ac.uk/), see also [manchester.ac.uk/discover/key-dates](https://www.manchester.ac.uk/discover/key-dates/) key dates.

* Other than the introductory lecture in week 1, there are no lectures. Instead we have workshops which are more like labs and may contain mini-lectures
* Workshops are on Wednesdays at 9am and Thursdays at 2pm / 3pm depending on your lab group
    <!--* [bit.ly/Tuesday-3pm-workshop](http://bit.ly/Tuesday-3pm-workshop)

    * [bit.ly/friday-1pm-workshop](http://bit.ly/friday-1pm-workshop)-->
* Team study sessions are on Tuesdays and Thursdays at 10am.

For online activities, everything is on Microsoft Teams.

<!--Because of constraints on the number of private channels in Teams, the year is arbitrarily split into two spaces:

1. [bit.ly/software-engineering-A](https://bit.ly/software-engineering-A)
1. [bit.ly/software-engineering-b](https://bit.ly/software-engineering-b)-->

Microsoft Teams is, as the name suggests, where you'll meet your team, details will appear here once teams have been assigned.

## Which lab should I go to {#campus}
